# Recipe-Wizard

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file in the `Server` directory:

```
RECIPE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can use the `.env.example` file as a template:

```sh
cp Server/.env.example Server/.env
```

Then, replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key.
